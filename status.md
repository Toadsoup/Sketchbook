I am at a point where I need to decide my path as a programmer.  I have decided to explore more languages and move away from php, but I have a ton of questions.  What languages and methodologies should I be using?  Is javascript really going to eat the world?  Is focusing on producing REST API's the way to go and let separate apps consume them?  What should I be using if not php?  Rails? Django? Node? IO?  

I will be creating a simple api using django and again in rails to test out both paths.  It would make sense to try node as well.  After getting a sense for both of these I will be further charting my course.

The API will basically give data from movies and a particular user's status in relation to it. (Watched/In Queue/None)

/api/movie/

/api/movie/(#id)

/api/user/

/api/user/(#id)

/api/user/(#id)/(status)


Get Movies 

Get Users

Get Status (For Movie By User)

Set Status

Delete Status
