The resources are for various programs or languages that I either like or have been frustrated by.

Once I was looking up an obscure solution for a MySQL query to clean up some wordpress formatting.  When I found the solution on a blog entry, I saw the first comment was from me - thanking the poster two years prior.

Since I have made this sketchbook, it has saved my bacon a number of times.  Usually small dumb things that I have quick reference to.  Additionally it has helped me commit items to my own memory.  I recommend everyone create a resources repo.
